Spacecraft Anomaly Data

A data base of spacecraft anomalies has been started at the Solar-
Terrestrial Physics Division of the National Geophysical Data Center in
1984.  It included the date, time, location, and other pertinent 
information about incidents of spacecraft operational irregularity due to the
environment.  These events range from minor operational problems which can be
easily corrected to permanent spacecraft failures.  The data base includes
spacecraft anomalies in interplanetary space and in near-earth orbit but it's
main component comes from geostationary spacecraft.

Many spacecraft are identified by aliases in order to preserve
confidentiality, these are prefaced with the "@" character.

Anomaly contributions slowed to a trickle and ceased in the early 1990s.
The orginal database files have been converted to Excel Spreadsheets,
however, here are the original column and field definitions.

     43  A1    Orbit type,  G= geostationary,  P= polar circular,
               E= elliptical, I= inclined, etc.
     44  A1    N= North, S= South for following latitude, blank => no Lat.
 45- 46  I2    Geographic latitude of sub-orbit point at anomaly start.
 47- 48  I2    Uncertainty in latitude (Degrees)
     49  A1    E= east, W= west for following longitude, blank => no Lat.
