## Project-description

In this project I am going to practice my statistical analysis knowledge by doing an study around the esports insdustry from the perspective of a prospect esports gamer. 

My intention is to make a confident decisions in terms of which game and genre should a gamer choose in order to win as many money as possible in the upcoming years. To make that decission I need to reply to several questions: 

- Is the esports industry actually a industry in awe? 
- What are the best games and best performing genres?
    - To answer that, we need to look at the total amount of millions of dollars given by tournaments
    - The amount of tournaments per year per game and genre to try to calculate the average peak life value per game and genre
    - What games gives a bigger amount of prizes and which one gives me a bigger probability to win at least a prize?
- How much time do I have to become a master between a game is released and the first tournament happens?

Ultimately, I would like to perform a time series analysis to determine what is the peak in the entire cycle of the game. 

## Workflow

I started looking at datasets, webpages and APIs from where I could take the information from. For the beggining of the project, I opted to use these two datasets from Kaggle.

- Esports Earnings 1998 - 2020 https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh/esports-earnings/notebooks

After gathering my data, I started with the exploratory data analysis to understand what operations should be made and how should I treat my data. In the end I merged the two datasets available and created some variables such as :

- I created an Awakening variable: it tells  me how many years each game takes to go into the esports industry after the release the date.
- Prize per person: this variable talks about the amount of prize given on average to the winners of the tournament. 

After doing the EDA and the consequent Data Wrangling I then started with the Data Visualization and relationship between variables and statistical analysis.
